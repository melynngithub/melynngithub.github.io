        <p>My name is Michelle Lynn and I am thrilled to be starting my 14th year with DCSD 
            and 1st year at Mountain Vista High School! For information about each class, 
            please click on the associated links in this website. If you have any questions, 
            the best way to reach me is via email: <a href = "mailto:melynn@dcsdk12.org"> melynn@dcsdk12.org</a>.

            I began my working life as a clinical dietitian but soon became the hospital computer expert. 
            When my husband and I moved to Colorado, I started working for a computer training company and 
            there I learned a great deal about software, hardware, and web design. I then obtained my master's 
            degree in Information and Learning Technologies from CU Denver. I began my teaching career at Fox 
            Creek Elementary as the Technology Teacher and CRT - (the person who does ALL the computer ordering,
            repairs, training, etc.). I then moved to Castle Rock Middle School where I started the Computer 
            Science Program. I also work with Code.org as a facilitator for other teachers who are learning how 
            to teach computer science in their classrooms and I help with the Code.org forum answering teacher 
            questions and helping to debug student programs. I also have my CTE credentials in Information Technology.

            When I am not teaching technology, you can find me spending time with my family. My husband and 
            I both grew up in Oklahoma and graduated from the University of Oklahoma. We are avid college 
            football fans! (BOOMER!!) We have two sons both at CU. We love spending time in the mountains, 
            hiking, biking, skiing, and generally enjoying the outdoors. Personally, I love reading, tacos, 
            chips and salsa, paddle boarding, and family time.
